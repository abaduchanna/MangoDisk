# Bundled PawnIO components

These are unmodified official vendor binaries. They are embedded only in the
Windows `MangoDiskPrivileged` executable, not in the desktop executable or
macOS/Linux builds. Bundling does not install or enable them: installation is
an explicit user action requiring administrator approval.

The official installer is a proprietary distribution whose redistribution is
allowed by upstream. Its original bytes, signatures and embedded notices are
preserved. This does not relicense it under MangoDisk's license.

The modules are distributed under GNU LGPL 2.1. Their unmodified upstream license
is in `modules/0.2.11/COPYING`; the exact corresponding source is available at
the versioned module source link above. The Windows application package includes
this notice and the license under its `licenses` resource directory.

When updating a vendor release, replace the original binary, its pinned digest
in `src/artifacts.rs`, size assertions in `src/vendor_payloads.rs`, provenance
and applicable notices together. Verify the installer's official Authenticode
signature and the module's compatibility with the signed PawnIO driver. Never
patch vendor binaries or substitute an unsigned driver/module.
